    "section": "The Initial Offering of Energy and the Environment",
    "text": "The Initial Offering of Energy and the Environment\nEnergy and the environment offers an extremely broad range of topics that might be considered. I decided to examine “energy flows” that start with one or more inputs taken from the environment and end with the consumption energy to achieve a desired outcome such as propulsion of a vehicle, heating of a building, operating a computer, etc. Along any one energy flow, there are a variety of transportation, storage, processing and conversion steps. The energy flow “touches” the enviroment at almost every step by taking additional inputs from the environment, releasing materials back to the environment, or altering ecosystems. Many energy flows also produce byproducts that add environmental impacts as they are produced, used and ultimately disposed of. In principle, a large set of environmental impacts can be mapped to each energy flow.\nIt isn’t possible to follow every energy flow, but by considering varied starting inputs and end uses, an appreciation for the range and magnitude of environmental impacts can be gained. From each starting input, there may be paths to a number of end uses, and the energy consumed in each end use may have originated from a number of starting inputs. Examining energy flows that use common starting inputs or energy flows that support the same end use can reveal environmental, and other, trade-offs associated with different energy flows.\nI had a number of goals in mind as I considered how to structure the course.\n\nGiven that a comprehensive examination of energy and the environment is not feasible, I wanted to give the students freedom to choose the aspects that most interest them. I reasoned that they are more likely to engage in learning when they can choose to learn about something of personal interest to them.\nI wanted the students to be aware that there are many different ways that energy production and use impact the environment other than the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\nI wanted to stress life-cycle analysis and help students understand, for example, that while an electric vehicle does not emit carbon dioxide, the production and distribution of the electricity that powers that vehicle does.\nI wanted to stress techno-economic analysis and raise the students’ awareness that processes must be economically viable in order for anyone to implement them.\nI wanted to increase student awareness of new technical developments and proposed legislation in the field of energy that relate to its environmental impact.\nI wanted the students to gain an appreciation of the challenges and consequences of shifting the country’s energy portfolio to one that is more environmentally friendly.\nFinally, I wanted to stress the positive possibilities and avoid the sense that it is hopeless.\n\nI tried to develop learning objectives that, if met, would result in meaningful understanding of energy and the environment, but that still afforded flexibility and latitude with respect to the focus and scope of that understanding. The learning objectives for the course were that upon completion of the course, students would be able to\n\nlist and discuss current issues related to energy and environment,\nperform preliminary techno-economic and life cycle analyses on an energy flow, and\nidentify and discuss environmental impacts of using different primary energy sources.\n\nThe class met twice a week with each meeting lasting 80 minutes. Apart from a few days spent introducing the concepts of energy flows, life-cycle analysis, and techno-economic analysis, the course structure consisted of six energy flow analysis cycles together with “current events” presentations. I selected the first energy flow (coal as the starting input and powering an electric vehicle as the end use). The other five were suggested and chosen by the class.\nEach energy flow analysis cycle took four class days.\n\nDay 1\n\nSelection of the energy flow to be analyzed followed by brainstorming on the steps involved in that energy flow and what the class needed to learn to inform a life cycle analysis and a techno-economic analysis of the energy flow. Over the next two class days, the students were expected to gather relevant facts, data, and information identified during brainstorming, and to add to list of things they needed to learn.\n\nDays 2 and 3\n\nDuring these classes, students were expected to share and discuss the facts, data, and information they had gathered on the basis of the original brainstorming, and to suggest additional topics that needed to be investigated to inform the life cycle and techno-economic analyses.\n\nDay 1 of Next Analysis Cycle\n\nBy the end of Day 3, above, it was expected that as much information as possible had been gathered. A group of 3 or 4 students were then expected to use the gathered information and make a summary presentation about the energy flow including the technical details of the energy flow, a life cycle analysis and a techno-economic analysis. To afford them sufficient time, Day 1 for the next energy flow analysis cycle occured between Day 3 and Day 4 of the current energy flow analysis. This allowed a minimum of one week between the end of information gathering and the due date for the summary presentation.\n\nDay 4\n\nA group of 3 or 4 students gave a summary presentation about the energy flow.\n\n\nIn addition to the energy flow analysis activities on a given day, two 15-minute current events presentations were made at every class meeting by individual students on a topic of their choosing. The current event topic was expected to be related in some way to energy and the environment.\nThe course logistics centered on discussion boards on the course learning management system. One discussion board was for students to suggest energy flows to be analyzed in the remaining energy flow analysis cycles. In a survey due at the start of Day 1 above, the students voted for the next energy flow to be analyzed.\nDiscussion boards were created for each energy flow analysis. As the students gathered information identified during Day 1 brainstorming, they added it to this discussion board. The group making the summary presentation was expected to draw from this information when preparing their presentation, and they were expected to post the slides from their presentation to it.\nA separate discussion board was used for current events. Students were expected to post the source article for their current events presentation on this board no more than a week before their presentation. They then posted their slides for the presentation before class on the day they presented it. In choosing their source article, they were expected to check the past and pending presentations to avoid duplicating a previous current event presentation.\nThe course was dual listed as both an undergraduate and a graduate course. The expectations for those taking the undergraduate course were to (1) attend every class and participate in discussions (attendance was recorded for each class), (2) to share at least one item they gathered (based on brainstorming) for each energy flow analysis, and (3) to make two current events presentations to the class. Those taking the graduate course were only expected to make two current events presentaions, but they additionally were expected to participate in two group energy-flow summary presentations.",

    "title": "Goal Structure",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In my July 3, 2023 post I suggested that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing a problem-solving assignment. Then in my July 18, 2023 post I described four goal orientations that influence the manner in which a student completes a problem-solving assignment. I described four achievement goal orientations that students may hold. Students with a performance approach goal orientation seek to demonstrate their ability. In problem-solving this can translate getting the correct answer being the goal. Learners with a mastery approach goal orientation seek to develop their ability. In problem-solving this can translate to knowing how to solve the problem. Students with a performance avoidance goal orientation seek to avoid demonstrating their inability. In problem-solving this can again translate to getting the correct answer as the goal. Finally students with a mastery avoidance goal orientation seek to avoid missing an opportunity to develop their ability. In problem-solving this can translate to knowing how to solve every variant of a given type of problem.\nSo if a student’s goal orientation influences how they approach a problem-solving assignment, and if the manner in which homework is presented can affect the student’s approach, it remains to relate the manner in which homework is presented to the goal orientation a student adopts. That is where goal structure comes in. In a nutshell, through their experiences in a course, students perceive a course goal structure. Perceived goal structure parallels achievement goal orientation. Students will perceive a performance approach, mastery approach, performance avoidance, or mastery avoidance goal structure. The goal structure a student perceives in a given course influences the goal orientation they adopt, and as already discussed, this affects their approach to assignments in the course. I think it is important to notice that goal structure is a perception. Different students taking the same course may perceive different goal structures. In part, that is because no two students have the exact same experiences while taking a course.\nI tend to think about the linkages between what I do as an instructor and the extent to which the course learning objectives are met in terms of Figure 1. Starting with the instructor, shown in orange, I set the learning objectives for the course, and the manner in which I convey the information and teach the skills necessary to meet them clearly can affect the learning outcomes (how fully each student meets the objectives). I also play a role in establishing the course environment, and this is what I will focus on later in the post. However, it is critically important to recognize that I do not have exclusive control of either the course environment or the learning outcomes. There are many other factors that shape the course environment and learning outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Indirect linkage between teaching and learning outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe blue box in the figure is meant to convey that a student’s perception of the course goal structure and the goal orientation they adopt are internal to that student. I cannot change either of them directly. Instead, as the figure suggests, I can only try to establish a course environment that will be perceived as a mastery approach goal structure. I’ve already noted that each student’s goal orientation will affect the learning behaviors that they employ (right side of the figure). I can try to influence those learning behaviors (dashed orange arrow) by suggesting effective ways to study, etc. but ultimately learning behavior is under the student’s control. Again, there are a variety of other factors that will also impact the learning behaviors that the student ultimately employs. If I do a good job of conveying the necessary knowledge and skills and the student utilizes adaptive learning behaviors, the learning outcomes should meet or exceed the learning objectives.\nThis is the basis for my previous claim that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing a problem-solving activity. However, the way homework is presented is just one part of the course environment. If I alter the way I present homework assignments in ways suggesting a mastery approach goal structure, but every other aspect of the course environment suggests, for example, a performance approach goal structure, I can’t expect my alterations to be effective. It is necessary to holistically address the course environment if I hope to influence student goal orientations.\nBut for now, let’s just look at homework and how it is presented. The first thing to decide is what purpose or purposes you want the homework to serve. It is OK to use homework assignments as a means of assessing learning outcomes. I personally don’t think it is a very effective or accurate means of assessment, but as long as the students have opportunities to practice, fail and learn from their mistakes before being assessed, it is OK to use homework in this way. Students should be advised of the purpose of the assignment. I think many instructors think of homework as both a practice/learning activity and an assessment. If that’s the intended purpose, it is important to emphasize to the students that the homework is intended to be a practice/learning acitivty. To me this is a kind of mixed messaging that could result in a mastery-approach goal structure, but that is more likely to yield a performance approach goal structure.\nIn my problem-solving course the purpose of homework is completely for practice, learning, and self-assessment. I have found that if homework is optional, many students do not complete it. Therefore I “grade” homework assignments on effort and not on whether the correct answer was obtained. I give the solution to the problem to the students as a part of the assignment. I tell them to try to solve the problem as if they are taking an exam, and to only refer to the solution if they get stuck. They are instructed to compare their solution to the one I provided after they have completed the assignment to make sure they completed it correctly. I then ask them to write a brief reflection on the state of their understanding of that particular type of assignment and to identify things they can do if their understanding is not yet fully developed.\nI believe that taken together, this way of presenting homework sends a clear message that the purpose of homework is to learn how to solve problems. I often point out that if they know how to solve a problem, then they will get the correct answer, but if they get the correct answer by using non-adaptive learning behaviors, they may not know how to solve the problem independently. This presentation of homework is one of many things I do in my problem-solving course to try to establish a course environment that is perceived by students as a mastery-approach goal structure."

    "title": "Book Review: How Learning Works",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2013 I attended a conference on the future of engineering education. It brought together a number of engineering professors who were interested in improving the way engineers are educated in the U. S. I have the sense that like me, most in attendance did not have any formal training in education. One of the speakers noted that he, too, began conducting education research with no formal training in education. He said that a book by Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett and Norman was tremendously helpful when he was getting started. That book is “How Learning Works, 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching1.”\n“How Learning Works, 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching” provides a nice summary of research related to how people learn. It is conveniently organized, starting with an introduction where the authors present seven principles of how people learn that have emerged from decades of research on the topic. The principles are (1) students’ prior learning can help or hinder learning, (2) how students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know, (3) students’ motivation generates, directs and sustains what they do to learn, (4) to develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned, (5) goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning, (6) students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning, and (7) to become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.\nThat introductory chapter is followed by seven chapters that each focus on one of the seven principles I just listed. These seven chapters are all structured the same way. They begin with two short vignettes. In each vignette a professor describes something they experienced in an actual classroom. The chapter then proceeds to analyze what was going on in each vignette, showing how that chapter’s learning principle applies. A nice summary of related research literature and findings that support the principle follows. Each of these chapters next presents strategies, based on that literature, that might be used in the situations described in the vignettes. Each of these chapters concludes with a summary. Following the seven chapters focused on the learning principles, an overall conclusion is presented.\nThe back portion of the book has eight appendices and a comprehensive list of references. The appendices describe things that might help address an issue related to one of the learning principles. They all begin with “What is,” or “What are.” For example, Appendix F is titled “What are Exam Wrappers and How Can We Use Them.” The subjects of the other appendices are student self-assessment, concept maps, rubrics, learning objectives, ground rules, checklists and reader response/peer review.\nI have found myself going back to this book repeatedly since I first read it. I highly recommend “How Learning Works.” You don’t need to be an educational specialist to read and understand it. It’s a great and accessible way for teachers and students alike to broaden their understanding of how learning works."

    "title": "Achievement Goals",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this post, I’d like to build on the suggestion in my last post that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing the homework assignment. When a student undertakes a task, such as a homework assignment, there is something they hope to accomplish by completing it. The thing they hope to accomplish can be called an achievement goal. Achievement goal theory categorizes achievement goals, describes their origins, and explains their consequences. (Many good reviews on achievement goal theory are available, for example1 2.)\nAccording to achievement goal theory, students may hold one of four achievement goal orientations. These are called performance approach, mastery approach, performance avoidance and mastery avoidance goal orientations. A student with a performance approach goal orientation wants to demonstrate their ability. In the context of solving homework problems in an engineering problem-solving course, I believe that this translates to a goal of getting the correct answer. In contrast, a student holding a mastery approach goal orientation wants to develop their ability. In terms of solving homework problems, I think of this goal as wanting to know how to get the correct answer.\nA student holding a performance avoidance goal orientation approaches a task with the goal of not performing more poorly than others. In a problem-solving course this might translate to a goal of not getting the wrong answer. In my limited reading in the area, mastery avoidance goal orientations are not as well defined as the other orientaions. A mastery avoidance goal might be to avoid being unable to get the correct answer, but it also could mean completing a task to avoid losing the knowledge of how to get the correct answer.\nThe goal orientation that a student adopts has a direct impact upon the learning behaviors they exhibit. From a teaching perspective, it is desirable for students to adopt a mastery approach goal orientation. Students with a mastery approach goal orientation want to know what to do to solve a problem and they want to understand why they need to do it. Understanding why they perform a given sequence of steps to solve a problem is expected to lead to more persistent knowledge, and it is expected to be more easily transferrable to solving future problems.\nStudents who adopt a performace approach goal orientation may exhibit less desirable learning behaviors because their goal is focused upon the answer and not the path to the answer. For example, a student with a performance approach goal orientation may be more likely to employ a mimicry approach to problem solving. They find a solved problem that appears to be similar to the problem at hand and then mimick the approach used to solve that problem. If the goal is getting the correct answer, this is the most efficient route, short of copying. Over time as more and more problems are solved, these students will know how to solve the type of problem at hand. However, it is not an efficient approach to developing understanding.\nAnother undesirable learning behavior that can result from a performance approach goal orientation is not using feedback. Feedback is provided after the student has either demonstrated they can get the correct answer or failed to do so. In terms of their goal, reading comments on their work or comparing their solution to one that is correct won’t change their goal outcome. Similarly, students who adopt a performance avoidance goal orientation may compare their solution to a correct one, but in doing so, they are often looking for places where they can “get a few points back,” and not looking to understand what they did wrong.\nSo in this post I’ve described some relationships between a student’s achievement goal orientation and the learning behaviors they display. I noted that the achievement goal orientation they hold may affect how they approach doing their homework assignments. This was necessary before I can talk about how the manner in which homework is presented can affect their approach. That will be my next topic, but here’s a brief preview. In their courses, students perceive a course goal structure with the same four types of goals. The course environment, e. g. the way homework is presented, influences the goal structure they perceive which affects the goal orientation they adopt which impacts the learning behaviors they employ."

    "title": "In-Class Practice",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In many ways, the ideal time and place for students to practice problem solving is during class. Many years ago I converted my problem-solving course to a flipped classroom format, but even before that, I started incorporating “Learning Activities” into my lectures. Instead of presenting the solution of a problem in class, I would assign the reading of a problem solution from the textbook to be completed before the class met. Then in place of presenting that solution in class, I instead had the class work through the solution to a similar problem as an in-class activity. If a solved problem is available that presents the solver’s thinking as they solve the problem that’s a great solution to assign for before class. If no such solution is available, as is often the case, I would encourage the students to write brief questions whenever they didn’t understand why the person solving the problem did what they did, or how the person solving the problem knew how to do what they did.\nIn my course, we typically spend several class meetings considering a given type of problem, so there are multiple opportunities for learning activities for a given problem type. Before we start each of these learning activities I remind the students of its purpose. I emphasize that the goal of the learning activity is for them to learn how to solve that type of problem, not getting the correct answer. I typically point out that getting the correct answer will occur naturally if they know how to approach solving the problem.\nI repeatedly point out that getting stuck during one of the in-class learning activities is the best thing that can happen to them. I tell them that when they get stuck they have either identified a point where they don’t know what to do or they’ve found something they don’t know how to do. I tell them that this is the purpose of the activity, because as soon as they identify that point, I’m right there to help them get unstuck. In fact, I generally encourage the students to work together with those sitting close to them as we progress through the activity, because often times, a student will more easily understand the explanation of a point from a classmate than they will my explanation. These activities are a good opportunity to attempt to establish a mastery-approach goal structure in the class by emphasizing that their objective during the activity should be to learn how to solve that type of problem and not to show me or their classmates that they got the correct answer.\nIn my last post, I argued that students need to practice more than how to solve a given problem. They need to practice identifying a problem’s type, they need to practice knowing which of the skills and knowledge they have acquired to use for a given problem type, they need to practice knowing the general approach for using those skllls and knowledge, and only after that do they need to practice actually solving the problem. For this reason, when I first show the problem statement, I start almost every learning activity with a question along the following lines.\n\nOkay, in today’s class we are studying [isolated ideal reactor modeling] problems, so you can be pretty sure that is a [isolated reactor modeling] problem. But supose that this was an exam covering the past six weeks of the course. How would you know that his is a [isolated reactor modeling] problem and not a [kinetics data analysis] problem or one of the other types of problems we’ve studied previously.\n\nOnce I get some responses and we’ve noted the distinguishing characteristics of the problem at hand that allow its identification, the next question I almost always ask is “what is the general approach for solving a [isolated reactor modeling] problem?” We then spend a few minutes outlining the general approach for solving the problem. Note that both the identification of the problem type and the general approach for solving it would have been presented earlier in this class and/or in previous classes.\nFrom this point on, we walk through that general approach for solving this type of problem, applying it to the specific problem in the learning activity. The first time we solve a given type of problem in a learning activity, the solution steps are highly scaffolded. That is, I list each step and then direct them how to complete it. This scaffolding is then gradually removed in subsequent learning activities that involve that same type of problem. By the last learning activity on that type of problem, I may only ask them how they know what type of problem it is and what is the general approach for solving it, after which I’ll simply tell them to jump in and solve it.\nUsed properly (and with buy-in from the students) I think these learning activities are the best way for students to practice, The biggest drawback is that time is limited, but having an expert there to get them un-stuck immediately is tremendously valuable. There are two other things that I think are very important.\nThe first is to walk among students as they work and not just stand at the front of the room. I find that students are more likely to ask me a question one-on-one as I stroll past them than they are to raise their hand and ask their question for whole class to hear. (When they are that brave, I always try to praise them for asking!)\nThe second important thing is that I provide a written solution. Due to the limited time available, some students likely won’t fully process the solution as we proceed through it in class. When I prepare this written solution, I eliminate the questions and the scaffolding, replacing them with factual statements that highlight my thinking. For example, in place of the learing activity question, ““how would you know this is an isolated reactor modeling problem?”, I might write “I can see that this is an isolated reactor modeling problem because….”\nIn my next post I’ll examine some other forms of practice, but as I said, I think in-class learning activities can offer the highest quality problem-solving practice."

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the seven research-based principles of “How Learning Works”1 states that “To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned.” Another says “Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning.” So two of seven priciples that are central to learning refer to the need for practice. One might then ask “What constitutes practice?”.\nIn a problem-solving course, homework can be a great opportunity for a student to practice. Previously, I’ve stated my opinion that homework that is graded and counts toward a student’s final course grade is not true practice. Yes, the student does need to go through the process of solving the problem, but their focus will likely be split. They know that they need to learn how to solve the type of problem they have been assigned, but they also know that their course grade depends upon the acccuracy of their solution.\nIn terms of goal structure, graded homework is at best split between making performance approach goals (getting the correct answer) and mastery approach goals (knowing how to get the correct answer) salient. Based upon the prevalence of outright copying (from a student or from an online source of the solution) and a mimicry approach to completing an assignment (mimic a solution to a, hopefully, similar problem), I suspect that graded homework establishes more of a performance approach goal structure than one of mastery approach.\nIndeed, I suspect that many students don’t think that deeply about it, and that they assume that they are learning when they utilize one of those approaches. They probably are learning to some extent, but using those approaches is not an efficient way to achieve problem-solving mastery.\nNow I’m not saying that graded homework is necessarily bad, but I do feel very strongly that any graded homework on a given type of problem should be preceded by ungraded opportunities to practice solving that type of problem. Before their ability is assessed, students should have the opportunity to attempt to solve a problem type, fail, and learn from their failure.\nI like sports. If you look in the record books for NFL quarterbacks, their pass completion percentage factors in only the passes they attempted during games. The amount of time they spend practicing football is probably ten or more times greater than the amount of time they spend playing actual games. They undoubtedly throw many, many more passes in practice than they throw in games. In practice they can try something new, and if it seems promising, they can develop it. They can also make mistakes and learn from them. (Coaching, i. e. targeted feedback can play a big role here, but that’s a topic for another day). The key point I’m making is that none of the passes they attempt during practice are included in their official pass completion percentage.\nTaking it a step further, those NFL quarterbacks have already thrown thousands of passes before they ever got to the NFL, and still, their practice passes (homework grades) are not included in their official statistics (final course grade). Students taking a problem-solving course may never have attempted a given problem type prior to a given homework assignment. They deserve the opportunity to throw a few passes in practice before they are put into a game where their completions will count toward their official completion percentage.\nSo what constitutes practice? In a problem-solving course, I’d say practice is an opportunity for a student to try to solve the same kind of problem that they will eventually be graded on. It’s an opportunity to “get stuck,” and thereby to identify and correct something they had not yet fully understood. It’s an opportunity to complete an assignment thinking they had “aced” it, only to learn that one of the steps they had taken was completely wrong and should have been done differently. It’s the opportunity to learn from all of those things without getting penalized."

    "text": "Welcome!\nWelcome to ToTaL Engineering which is short for thoughts on teaching and learning engineering. My name is Carl Lund, aka the BuffaloBadger, and I’ve been a professor of chemical engineering at the University at Buffalo1 since the fall of 1986. I’ve created this site as a place to reflect upon how the design and delivery of the courses I teach affect students’ educational experiences and outcomes in those courses. I’ll share my thoughts on what aspects of students’ educational experiences and outcomes I can I affect, and which ones I want to affect. I’ll share my efforts to improve students’ educational experiences and outcomes by modifying the design and delivery of my courses. I’ll present my assessment of those modifications, and I’ll suggest modifications for the future.\nThe site began life in 2023 as a blog named ToTaL PS, where the PS stood for problem solving. In less than a year it became apparent to me that writing short, bi-weekly blog posts was not for me. So I switched to the present format which I liken to keeping a journal about my teaching. New entries will not appear on any regular schedule, but when they do they likely will be longer and hopefully more cohesive. I’m teaching a new elective course this spring (2024) that does not involve traditional engineering problem solving. I expect to share my experiences teaching it, as well, so I renamed the site as ToTaL Engineering.\nRight now the site has three sections. The first is about the course I teach on chemical engineering kinetics and reaction engineering. I consider it to be a typical engineering problem-solving course. I’ve taught this course in all but three fall semesters since 1986. (It has only been offered in the fall during that time.) I have a lot to write before that section of the site catches up with my current practices when teaching the course.\nThe second section is about an elective course on energy and the environment. I am teaching this course for the very first time this spring (2024). So this section of the site will hopefully stay fairly closely synced with my current offering of the course. The third section of the site is an archive where the old ToTaL PS blog posts can be found.\nSo welcome to ToTaL Engineering. I hope it proves to be useful or insightful to both engineering instructors and engineering students.",

    "text": "Kinetics and Reaction Engineering: A Problem-Solving Course\nThis course is a required, undergraduate course on chemical kinetics and chemical reactor design. In this course, I present theories, derive and simplify equations, and show how to use the theory and equations to answer questions about the performance or behavior of some reactive process or system. The learning outcomes center around the learner being able to formulate and solve equations to answer similar questions about systems or processes to which the theory applies. The questions typically take the form of “story problems” that consist of a written paragraph or two that provide some information and then ask one or more questions. As such, I consider it to be a prototypical engineering problem-solving course.\nThe class has always carried three credits, and it has always been offered in the fall semester only. It meets for fifty minutes, three times per week over the course of 14 to 15 weeks, with a three-hour final exam period scheduled a few days to a week after classes end. Prior to the fall of 2008 it was listed in the fourth year of the four-year chemical engineering curriculum, and most of those enrolled were seniors. In fall of 2008 the curriculum was revised, and it was listed in the third year. However, students can delay taking it until their senior year without delaying their graduation. As a consequence, since 2008 a mix of juniors and seniors have typically enrolled in the course.\nBroadly, students learn to solve five types of problems in the course: rate expression generation, kinetics data analysis, isolated reactor modeling, reactor systems modeling and non-ideal reactor modeling. The same sets of equations are used in kinetics data analysis, isolated reactor modeling and reactor system modeling, but the manner in which they are used differs. The nature of the problems ranges from calculating response (one correct answer) through optimization (multiple “correct” answers) to design (partially specified problem with multiple “correct” answers).\nThere are three pre-requisite courses and one co-requisite course. One pre-requisite is a course on material and energy balances. The equations that are most often used in reaction engineering are derived from material and energy balances. The second pre-requisite is a course on differential equations. A large fraction of reaction engineering problems require the solution of differential equations, but in reaction engineering those equations are solved numerically. This is the reason for the co-requisite course which is about numerical methods. The final pre-requisite course is chemical thermodynamics. Many of the terms appearing in reaction engineering equations have thermodynamic origins.",

    "section": "About My Problem-Solving Course",
    "text": "About My Problem-Solving Course\nIn one type of engineering problem-solving course[refs?], the instructor presents theories, derives and simplifies equations and shows how to use the theory and equations to answer questions about the performance or behavior of some process or system. The learning outcomes in this kind of problem-solving course center around the learner being able to formulate and solve equations to answer a variety of questions about systems or processes to which the theory applies. The problems in this kind of problem-solving course are typically “story problems.” That is, they take the form of a few written paragraphs that provide some information and then ask one or more questions.\nIn a common approach to teaching this type of problem-solving course, the instructor delivers didactic lectures in class. Homework problems are regularly assigned to the students. The homework problems are graded and returned to the students, and the homework grades become some fraction of the final course grade. At periodic intervals, the students take exams where they are asked to solve similar problems. The exams are graded and become a larger fraction of the final course grade. In this first of three papers, one particular example of this type of problem-solving course taught using ths common approach is assessed. A number of shortcomings are identified and discussed, and pedagogic changes to address those shortcomings are suggested. The second paper describes the the redesign of the overall course structure and its re-assessesment, and third paper describes the redesign of homework, feedback and exams and final assessment of the resulting course.\nThe course being assessed here is a required, upper-division chemical engineering course on chemical reaction kinetics and reaction engineering. Broadly, students learn to solve five types of problems in the course: rate expression generation (e.g. from a reaction mechanism), kinetics data analysis, isolated reactor modeling, reactor systems modeling and non-ideal reactor modeling. The same equations (mole and energy balances on ideal reactors) are used to solve the kinetics data analysis, isolated reactor modeling and reactor system modeling problem types, but the equations are used in different ways: parameter estimation, calculation of response, system optimization and system design. The course is offered once per year, in the fall semester. The author has taught all but 3 offerings (1998, 1999 and 2000) of this course since 1986. From 1986 through 2005 the didaactic lecture format described above was used, and the course offerings assessed here used that format.\n\nCourse Offerings\nComplete records including gradebooks, syllabi and instructor notes were available for ten offerings of the course between 1986 and 2005. De-identified gradebooks from those ten offerings were used for the assessment of the didactic lecture approach to teaching. For each student the homework submission rate (percent of assignments that were submitted), exams score (the average of all exam scores) and the deviation of the exams score from the class average exams score were computed. The instructor’s notes from each offering were examined and relevant observations were extracted. Table @ref(tab:offering-data) provides summary information about the course offerings used in the assessment. It may be noted that the number of homework assignments per course offering varied between 9 and 12 except for the 2005 offering where there were 22 homework assignments. This large increase was the result of switching from one assignment per week (with several problems per assignment) to one assignment per class meeting (with one problem per assignment).\n{r offering-data} load(\"../results/course_offering_summary.rda\") course_offering_summary$sub_rate &lt;- signif(course_offering_summary$sub_rate,3) course_offering_summary$exams_score &lt;- signif(course_offering_summary$exams_score,3) kbl(course_offering_summary, booktabs=TRUE, escape=FALSE, caption=\"Course Offerings Assessed\",     col.names=linebreak(c(\"Year\",\"Number\\nof\\nStudents\",\"Number\\n of\\nAssignments\",\"Homework\\nSubmission\\nRate\",\"Number\\nof\\nExams\",\"Average\\nExams\\nScore\"),align = \"c\"),     align = \"cccccc\") %&gt;%    kable_classic() %&gt;%    kable_styling(latex_options = \"hold_position\",                 full_width = FALSE)\nThe learning objectives and information presented in the lectures was essentially the same every year. The table does not suggest a trend in exams score over time, but it does show year-to-year variation. This might be expected since no two offerings of the course are identical. Instead of comparing exams scores across multiple offerings of the course, the deviation of a student’s exams score from the mean for their course offering can be used. The boxplot in Figure @ref(fig:exams-scores) represents distributions of exams scores for the course offerings. In this figure the boxes enclose the interquartile range (25th through 75th percentiles), the horizontal lines within the boxes represent the median, the vertical lines span the first and fourth quartiles and the dots represent outliers. Figure @ref(fig:deviations) shows the same information for the deviations of the students exams scores from the mean exams score for their course offering. The figures show that using deviations from the mean exams score eliminates much of the year-to-year variation.\n{r exams-scores, fig.cap=\"Distributions of Exams Scores by Course Offering\"} load(\"../data/by_offering_data.rda\") scoresBox &lt;- ggplot(data = by_offering_data, aes(year,exam_score)) +   geom_boxplot() +   labs(x = \"Year\",        y = \"Exams Score (%)\")  scoresBox\n \n{r deviations, fig.cap=\"Distributions of Exams Scores Deviations by Cours Offering\"} deviationsBox &lt;- ggplot(data = by_offering_data, aes(year,dev)) +   geom_boxplot() +   labs(x = \"Year\",        y = \"Deviation from the Mean of the Course Offering Exams Scores (%)\")  deviationsBox\n\n\nThe Purpose and Basis for Assessment\nThe quote, “Learning is something that students do, not something that is done to them”, attributed to Alfie Kohn, brings out an important point. No matter how excellent the teaching and course design are, a student will likely fail to attain the course learning outcomes if they do not make an effort to do so. The primary purpose of this assessment was to determine what might be done to make it easier for students who do make an effort to meet the learning objectives of the course. Doing so might also lead to deeper and longer-lasting learning[refs]. The assessment was guided by three well-established principles of learning, referred to here as the mastery, feedback and motivation principles.\n\nThe Mastery Principle states that to develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned[refs].\nThe Feedback Principle states that states that goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning[refs].\nThe Motivation Principle states that students’ motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do to learn[refs].\n\nMotivation has many aspects[refs]; this assessment uses achievement goal theory[refs] to characterize motivation. According to achievement goal theory, students facing a task will adopt one of four achievement goal orientations[refs]: performance-approach (demonstrate competence), mastery-approach (develop competence), performance-avoidance (don’t show incompetence), or mastery-avoidance (don’t fail to fully develop competence). When the task is solving a homework problem, “getting the correct answer” is a performance-approach goal, “knowing how to solve the problem” is a mastery-approach goal, “not getting an incorrect answer” is a performance-avoidance goal and “not forgetting how to solve the problem” is a mastery-avoidance goal. Achievement goal theory further posits that instructor messaging, course policy, etc. create a course goal structure that makes one of the goal orientations salient in the class or course[refs]. A student’s perception of this goal structure influences the goal orientation they adopt[refs]. Generally, a mastery-approach goal orientation is desired by instructors because it is associated with favorable student learning behaviors and study strategies[refs].\n\n\nThe Assessment Method\nThe assessment considered both the instructor’s delivery of the course and the students’ approaches to learning (as observed by the instructor). Each aspect of the course was examined to determine whether it was detrimental, lacking or beneficial with respect to the following critical features extracted from the principles of learning, above.\n\nlearning component skills - here the component skills were considered to include understanding what reactor mole and energy balances are, being able to identify mole and energy balance equations for different types of ideal reactors, knowing how to simplify the equations when appropriate, knowing defining equations for quantities that appear in the balance equations or are used in the practice of reaction engineering, knowing how to solve the equations, knowing how to minimize or maximize quantities using the equations and knowing how to estimate parameters in the equations using experimental data.\nknowing which component skills to use and when to use them - here this is taken to include selecting the correct mole and energy balances for a given problem, knowing whether simplifications are permissible, knowing when and how to express variables in terms of different variables to formulate the equations and then knowing whether to estimate parameters appearing in the equations, solve the equations, minimize or maximize a quantity appearing in the equations or specify values for some quantities appearing in the equations to meet stated objectives.\npracticing of the integration of those component skills with the mastery-approach goal of knowing what to do and how to do it in order to answer a question - here it is assumed that getting the correct answer is a natural consequence if knowing how to get the answer is the primary goal.\nproviding timely, targeted feedback - here, in addition to identifying specific mistakes that were made on any one problem, the “targeting” is taken to include an assessment of current problem-solving mastery and ideas for improving it.\ncreating a mastery-approach course goal structure.\n\n\n\nAssessment of the Course\nDidactic Lectures The lectures organized and communicated component knowledge effectively. This was reinforced by the availability of many very good textbooks to which students were referred, typically with one being strongly recommended or required. The lectures, and many of the examples available in the textbooks, were also effective in describing and illustrating component skills wherein that knowledge is used to solve problems and answer questions. However, while they clearly showed what to do, they consistently failed to show or explain how the expert knew to do those things. Herein, this shortcoming will be referred to as failing to expose expert thinking.\nAdditionally, the instructor observed that students rarely, if ever, asked him how he knew to do what he did when solving a problem[refs]. The reason may well be that they don’t realize this gap exists in their understanding. That is, they may fully understand all of the steps that the instructor took when solving the problem. It isn’t until they are called upon to solve a problem from scratch that they realize that don’t know how to start or proceed. Unfortunately, if the students use the mimicry approach described below when they solve homework problems, and if they prepare for exams by reading solved problems, the first time they may become aware of this gap in their knowledge may be on an exam.\nThe author also observed that many students do not prepare prior to class, e. g. by completing pre-class reading assignments. As a consequence, they may not have identified points that are not clear to them and they may miss the opportunity to ask for clarification during the lecture.\nHomework The average homework submission rate was greater than 80% for all course offerings except in 1994 when it was 79.3%. Prior to 2005, the number of homework assignments was between 9 and 12. There were multiple questions per assignment with assignments due once per week. The instructor observed that many students completed the assignments just before they were due. During lectures, the instructor was the person solving problems while the students watched. As a consequence, many students went a week without actively engaging with the course until the next assignment came due. In an attempt to force more regular engagement, in 2005 the instructor switched to assignments that consisted of a single problem with an assignment due at each class meeting. This increased the number of assignments to 22, but did not appear to affect the submission rate which remained high (84.4%).\nHomework assignments were flawed in multiple respects. While they afforded some practice, they were also graded and counted in a student’s final grade for the course. As such, they were not true practice in the sense that they did not provide an opportunity to fail and learn from one’s failure without penalty. Additionally, the fact that they were graded on the accuracy of the answer obtained might have contributed to establishing a performance-approach goal structure. That is, if the homework is graded on accuracy and counts toward the final grade, students are likely to make getting the correct answer their goal when solving it. The homework assignments contained little, if any, messaging on the importance of knowing how to get the correct answer.\nThe instructor observed that many students employed a mimicry approach when solving homework[refs]. That is, instead of trying to solve the problem themselves, they began by locating a solved problem that appeared to be similar to the assigned problem and then mimicked that solution. Worse, students sometimes found a solution to the assigned problem and essentially copied it. While mimicry can eventually lead to learning, there are more effective learning strategies[refs]. In essence, mimicry is a very efficient way to get the correct answer, but is less effective for developing mastery. The popularity of the mimicry approach strongly suggests that the students had adopted a performance-approach goal orientation (get the correct answer) and not a mastery-approach orientation. It is critically important to note that when a student uses the mimicry approach, they don’t need to know what to do, but only how to do it. That is, they are not required to practice expert thinking because the solution they are mimicking provides it.\nAs already noted, the instructor observed that many students did not begin homework solutions until the last minute. As a result, if they realized while solving a problem that they didn’t fully understand something, they were unable to seek clarification or ask questions before the homework was due. As noted next, they may or may not have gotten that clarification from the feedback on their homework, or by seeking help outside of the classroom.\nHomework Feedback After each homework assignment was submitted, it was graded and marked at points where mistakes had been made. Feedback on the students’ solutions then consisted of returning the marked submissions and posting a correct solution that they could refer to. This form of feedback is also flawed in many respects. Like the examples presented in lecture, the posted solutions showed failed to expose expert thinking. Marking mistakes and posting a solution puts the onus on the student to compare their solution to the posted solution, determine what they did wrong and understand what they should have done instead. The learning principles state that feedback should be targeted. This form of feedback targets the reason the student failed to get the correct answer. It does not target whether or not the student knew how to get the correct answer. As such, its targeting may contribute to a performance-approach course goal structure and student adoption of performance-approach goals.\nFeedback also should be timely[refs]. Generally the marking of homework submissions was completed in a week or less, and always before the next exam. Still, there was a delay between when the students complete the assignment and when the feedback was available. The instructor observation that many students do not pick up their marked solutions in a timely manner exacerbates this shortcoming[refs]. By the time the feedback is received, the student may not recall their thought processes at the time they were solving the problem, making it difficult to identify a misconception of how to solve that type of problem. In some cases, the students never received any feedback either because they did not pick up their graded homework or because they did not look at it or the posted solution[refs].\nHelp-Seeking Opportunities In addition to asking whether students had any questions during each lecture, the instructor and the teaching assistants held regular office hours. This provided three or more different times each week when students could seek help. The instructor observed that during office hours some students asked questions in order to clarify their understanding of the component knowledge and skills or how to use them to solve problems. However, other students’ questions revolved around the number of points they lost for a particular marked mistake[refs]. The author takes this as an indicator of those students holding a performance-approach goal orientation. In some cases, the latter questions indicated that the students had not looked at the posted solution, which, in turn, indicates that they did make use of the feedback it provided[refs].\nExams The questions on exams were similar to questions on homework assignments and each exam question could be mapped to a specific course learning objective. There were no “trick” questions (at least not intentionally) and the instructor attempted to maintain a consistent level of difficulty both between homework and exams and across course offerings. The lecture content was effectively the same in all course offerings. Given those factors and the similarity of the deviations in Figure @ref(fig:deviations), the deviation of a student’s exams score from the mean of the exams scores for their class offering was taken to be good indicator of that student’s attainment of the course learning objectives.\n{r trendline} sub_dev_fit &lt;- lm(dev ~ sub, data = by_offering_data) sub_dev_coef &lt;- summary(sub_dev_fit)$adj.r.squared\nUnfortunately, the available data did not provide measures of either student effort or student motivation. A student’s homework submission rate might represent a crude indicator of effort, in which case some association between homework submission rate and exams scores might be expected. Figure @ref(fig:scatter) suggests neither a strong correlation nor a highly positive one. Indeed, the least-squares trendline shown in the figure has a slope of r round(sub_dev_fit$coefficients[2],3) and R2 is equal to r  round(sub_dev_coef,3).\n{r scatter, fig.cap=\"Association between Submission Rate and Exams Score Deviations\"} subDevCorrel &lt;- ggplot(by_offering_data, mapping = aes(x=sub, y=dev)) +   geom_point() +   labs(x = \"Homework Submission Rate (%)\",        y = \"Exams Score Deviation (%)\") +   geom_abline(slope = sub_dev_fit$coefficients[2], intercept = sub_dev_fit$coefficients[1]) subDevCorrel\nWhen examining the scatterplot it should be recognized that some students will submit a homework solution in hope of getting some points for it even though they did not make a strong effort to actually solve the problem or problems[refs]. Further, only certain discrete homework submission rates are possible, with the possible rates determined by the total number of assignments. Despite the weak overall correlation, examination of the deviations for students with a 100% homework submission rate is revealing. The distribution of exams scores deviations among student with a 100% submission rate is broader than the distribution of all other students combined. Put differently the student with the largest positive deviation and the student with the most negative deviation both submitted 100% of the homework! This observation, together with the relatively low trendline slope, clearly establishes that submission of homework assignments does not necessarily result in attainment of the course learning outcomes.\nThis raises the question, “are homework assignments ineffective teaching and learning tools, or alternatively, is there a better measure of a student’s effort to learn through completion of homework assignments than their homework submission rate?” The only measure of effort in the present data is the homework submission rate, so this question remains unanswered. On the basis of the learning principled, the author believes that homework problems can be highly beneficial and effective learning tools, but in the present course both the manner in which homework is implemented and the metric used to measure homework can be improved.\nThe instructor observed that on exams, some students attempt to solve a problem using an approach that applies to a different type of problem (e.g. they attempt to solve a reactor response problem using an approach that applies to a parameter estimation problem). The instructor found that some students worked to the very end of the time allotted for exams and still were unable to complete their solution. Some students commented that they always get anxious during exams and it affects their performance[refs].\nThe instructor also noted that many students study for exams by reading and examining problems for which a solution is available[refs]. They strive to ensure that they understand those solutions, but never determine whether they can solve problems independently without having a solution to mimic. If the solved problems do not expose expert thinking, studying in this way may be incomplete. Indeed, in the days immediately before exams, the instructor did caution the classes that understanding and being able to explain someone else’s solution to a problem is not the same as being able to generate that solution independently.\nExams Feedback Feedback on exam solutions was similar to homework feedback. The biggest difference is that in addition to posting the solution, the instructor presented an accelerated solution to the exam problems as part of a class lecture. The shortcomings and flaws associated with this feedback were essentially the same as for homework feedback.\nSummary The following list offers a summary of finding of findings related to the structure and teaching of the course.\n\nThe didactic lectures effectively communicate component knowledge and skills needed in the course.\nLecture and textbook examples and posted homework and exam solutions all fail to expose expert thinking.\nThe students are not provided with any opportunity for authentic practice where they can fail and learn from their mistakes without it counting as part of their course grade.\nGrading all homework for accuracy and including the resulting scores as part of the overall course grade may contribute to establishing a performance-approach course goal structure.\n\nIn the extreme, some students may perceive homework assignments as purely evaluative and not as opportunities to learn.\nStudents are rarely encouraged to treat problem-solving activities as opportunities to identify and address misconceptions they hold.\n\nFeedback provided by marking homework and exam submissions and posting a correct solution is incomplete, inappropriately targeted and not timely.\nSome students are not able to complete the solution of an exam in the allotted time and others report exam anxiety.\n\nThe assessment also generated findings and observations related to student learning behaviors. These are based on observation making their prevalence known. In the following list the observations will be attributed to “some students,” but “many students” or “a few students” might be more appropriate for items.\n\nSome students do not prepare prior to class meetings.\nSome students employ a mimicry approach when solving homework; it is efficient in terms of getting the correct answer, but there are more effective approaches in terms of knowing how to get the correct answer.\nSome students do not begin assignments far enough in advance of the due date to allow themselves the opportunity to seek help or clarification should they get stuck.\nThe focus of some students’ questions during office hours is points deducted for a mistake, not understanding the mistake.\nSome students do not make appropriate use of marked submissions and posted solutions as feedback.\n\nSome never look at the posted solution or compare their solution to it.\nSome look only to see if they have grounds to seek a higher grade.\n\nSome students do not reflect upon the extent of their understanding nor adjust their learning behaviors to increase it.\nWhen studying for exams, some students fail to appreciate the difference between understanding someone else’s solution to a problem and being able to generate that solution themself.\n\n\n\nCourse Revision Goals\nThe preceding assessment identified a number of issues associated with the delivery and teaching of the course and with the learning behaviors adopted by students. The delivery and teaching items are under the direct control of the instructor. While the learning behaviors are not directly under the instructor’s control, the instructor can attempt to influence them. This section lists several course revision goals that address those issues. The rationale for each goal is presented, one or more course revisions that target the goal are identified, the reasoning behind the revisions is explained and potential issues are discussed.\nInduce Pre-Class Preparation A student who has not been exposed to the topic being considered in class will derive less benefit from attending class than a prepared student. The assessment indicated that many students do not complete pre-class reading assignments. At the same time, the manner and extent to which a student prepares for each class meeting is not under the instructor’s direct control. For these reasons, it may be desirable or necessary to provide inducements to the students to prepare for class.\nAt the end of most class meetings, the instructor summarizes that class, mentions the topic of the next class, reiterates the pre-class preparation assignment for the upcoming class and reminds students when the next homework assignment is due. This end-of-class procedure can be revised to explain to the students why the pre-class preparation assignment is important and how it will help them derive more from class time. They can be told that they may not understand everything they encounter in the pre-class preparation assignment, but that is good because they will then know to ask questions about the things they don’t fully understand. They can be told that it will also be easier to follow along in class without getting lost if they have completed the pre-class preparation assignment. This need not be done at the end of every class meeting, but the message should be repeated regularly and particularly when the instructor senses a lack of pre-class preparation.\nA second possible revision is to start giving short, online quizzes that are due just before the class meets. The objective of these quizzes is to induce pre-class preparation, so they should not evaluate understanding of the pre-class topics. Instead, it should be possible to find the answers to quiz questions within the pre-classs preparation assignment (e.g. a true/false question can consist of a statement taken directly from a pre-class reading). These quizzes should have a small number of questions, perhaps five, and not be time-consuming to complete. Multiple choice, true-false, matching and fill in the blank question types should be used. If possible they should be automatically graded by a course learning management system.\nThe main issue to consider when using pre-class quizzes of this type is their point value relative to the overall course score. The author believes that the overall course score should be a strong indicator of the degree to which a student has attained the course learning objectives. If the value of the quizzes is too low, they won’t induce students to complete the pre-class preparation assignments. If the value is too high, they could significantly increase the overall course score. Since they do not evaluate understanding, this is not desirable. Having the total possible points awarded for these quizzes represent 5% or less of the overall course score seems reasonable.\nCommunicate Necessary Information and Illustrate its Use Students must know relevant theory and definitions, be able to recognize important equations, know how to simplify equations, etc. and they need to know how to use that information to solve problems and answer questions. The assessment indicated that the didactic lectures were an effective means of communicating this information, with the exception of exposing expert thinking which is the next item on this list.\nHowever, using class time for this purpose may be sub-optimal. The teaching format could be revised so that this information transfer occurs outside of the classroom, via videos and/or readings. Class time could then be used to engage students in using the information and for providing instant access to and immediate feedback from the instructor. This teaching format, now known as a flipped classroom, has been advocated for this very reason.\nTwo potential issues can be identified. First, one of the advantages of didactic lectures is that the instructor curates the information available in the textbook, presenting and expounding on only the more important aspects. In most cases, simply replacing didactic lectures with assignments to read sections of the textbook does not provide an equivalent level of curation. While producing videos of didactic lectures has other drawbacks, it at least preserves the curation.\nThe second issue has already been mentioned: inducing pre-class preparation. If information transfer is moved out of the classroom, it becomes much more important that students do, in fact, prepare for class. This needs to be communicated to the students and the inducements for preparing must be effective. Even so, each in-class session should begin with a very brief review of the most important points from the pre-class assignment and an opportunity for the students to ask questions.\nExpose Expert Thinking The mastery principle notes that once students have acquired necessary component knowledge, they must know when to use it. The assessment concluded that the didactic lectures effectively communicated the requisite knowledge and how to use it, but they failed to teach the student to know when to use that knowledge. That is, they failed to expose expert thinking. Potential revisions to address this goal involve adding content to the lectures and to posted solutions to homework and exam problems.\nAs information is presented over the duration of the course, each time a new type of problem is encountered for the first time, the lectures can be revised to explicitly explain how an expert would identify the new problem type and differentiate it from other problem types. This can then be followed by an enumeration of the general steps used by an expert when solving that type of problem. Importantly, the students should be made aware that they need to know these things to be successful in the course.\nA second potential revision involves exposing expert thinking each time the instructor illustrates the solution of a problem. Between reading the problem and describing the first step toward solving it, a brief presentation/explanation of how the instructor knows what to do can be inserted. If in-class learning activities include problem-solving, as proposed in the next item listed, the students can be given an opportunity to practice expert thinking as part of the activity. A third potential revision involves adding expert thinking between the problem statement and the first step in the solution to every worked problem, homework problem solution and exam problem solution provided to the students. The main issue with this revision is that many textbook examples do not expose expert thinking directly. The instructor may want to provide addenda for examples in pre-class readings that do not expose expert thinking. If illustration of the use of information is being moved from an in-class didactic lecture to a pre-class video, the expert thinking can be added at the time the video is recorded.\nProvide Authentic Practice Both the mastery principle and the feedback principle indicate that practice is essential. As used here, “authentic” practice means a student can attempt to solve a problem and make a significant, even outlandish, mistake and not be penalized for it. When coupled with a mastery-approach goal orientation and appropriate feedback, the only impact on the student who makes the mistake is that they learn from it. If the course is revised to use a flipped classroom format as suggested above, the majority of in-class time can then be devoted to problem solving activities that are neither turned in nor graded in any way. When a new problem type is first encountered, these activities can be scaffolded to guide the students through the solution. Then, as they gain experience with that problem type, the scaffolding can be removed. The scaffolding should expose expert thinking by including identification of the problem type and enumeration of the general process for obtaining an answer. If the technology is available, another option is to use clickers in the scaffolded portion of an activity. If student participation in activities like these is observed to be an issue, a possible inducement to participate might involve awarding participation points for answering clicker questions (irrespective of whether the answer was correct). In-class problem solving actvities also present opportunities for mastery coaching and timely, targeted feedback, as described below.\nA second potential course revision to provide authentic practice involves not grading the accuracy of every homework assignment. This can take a number of forms, each with its own issues: (i) making some/all homework assignments optional, (ii) requiring submission of some/all assignments and awarding points for submitting it without grading it for accuracy or (iii) requiring submission of some/all assignments but grading them only on the basis of the apparent effort put forth and not their accuracy. The issues with all of these revisions come down to inducements. With no grade and no inducement, some students won’t complete the assignments. Large inducements introduce the possibility of increasing a student’s overall course score despite their solutions being incorrect. As with inducements considered previously, a careful and thoughtful balance is required. By eliminating homework assignments the previously counted toward overall course score, these revisions may cause exam scores to become more heavily weighted in the overall evaluation of the students. Care must be taken to ensure the exams represent a true and fair measure of a student’s attainment of the learning objectives.\nFor any homework assignment that is optional, required but not graded or graded on effort only, the problem statement should explicitly say that the purpose of that assignment is for the students to practice solving the problem so they can gauge their readiness for answering a similar question on an exam. They should be told that while getting the correct answer is important, knowing how to solve the problem is more important. If other assignments are graded for correctness and accuracy, the students should periodically be reminded that homework assignments are not only intended to evaluate their abilities, but also to provide them with opportunities to practice and develop those abilities.\nProvide Feedback that is Timely, Complete and Properly Targeted Feedback can help students identify their misunderstandings and misconceptions, as well as motivate (or de-motivate) them to persevere. The assessment indicated that in this course, the feedback was not timely, it helped the students find mistakes, but left it to them to associate those mistakes with an underlying misunderstanding. It implicitly targeted getting the correct answer. Several potential revisions could address these shortcomings.\nIf the course is flipped and class time is largely devoted to problem-solving activities, the instructor can circulate among the students checking their progress and answering their questions. If a question arises several times or the instructor observes multiple students sharing the same misconception, the activity can be interupted with a brief mini-lecture addressing that misconception. (The same can be done with clicker questions if a large percentage of the participants do not answer correctly.) In this way, the students can receive instantaneous feedback that is targeted to correct misunderstanding and increase mastery. The instructor can also comment on how their mastery is improving to individuals or the whole class. Alternatively the instructor can tell the class to reflect upon their progress since they first begain solving a particular type of problem, etc. These revision may provide motivation.\nAnother potential revision is to implement the use of homework wrappers with each homework assignment. As used here, a homework wrapper is a short writing within which the student reflects upon their solution to the problem. The question should be written so that in order to respond appropriately, the students will need to compare their solution to the posted, correct solution, assess their ability to solve problems of this type and determine what they can do to improve their mastery if need be. As such, homework wrappers can help students make better use of the feedback a posted solution provides and simultaneously lead them to self-generate feedback that is targeted on mastery over performance. The instructor can also respond to submitted wrappers with encouraging comments, comments intended to clarify a point, suggestion to meet during office hours, etc.\nEquitably Evaluate Learning Outcomes In the course assessment the instructor noted that some students could not complete exams in the allotted time and other students stated that anxiety often results in exam solutions that don’t accuratey reflect their abilities and understanding. It was also noted above that if less (or none) of the homework assignments are graded and included in overall course score, then exams will assume a larger fraction of the students’ final grades.\nPotentially the type and format of student evaluation can be revised to better reflect a student’s attainment of the course learning objectives. One of the few positive results of the COVID-19 pandemic was that some instructors were uncomfortable with giving exams via teleconference and devised alternative forms of evaluation including projects, papers, etc. Those changes are all potential revisions that can establish a more equitable evaluation of student learning. One change that the author made was to increase the number of exams, with only one problem on each exam. Further, the exams were split into an in-class portion and a take home portion. On the in-class portion the students were told to fully formulate the solution to the problem, but not to perform any of the associated calculations. They were then given 24 hours for the take-home part of the exam wherein they were to perform the calculations. This potential revision, by having only one problem and not requiring in-class calculations, greatly reduces the pressure or need to rush that some students feel while taking the exam. It reduces the reward for speed in favor of rewarding understanding.\nEstablish a Mastery-Approach Course Goal Structure According to achievement goal theory, students perceive a course goal structure based on instructor messaging, course policy, etc. The perceived goal structure influences the goal orientation that students adopt, and that, in turn, affects their learning behaviors and study methods. A master-approach goal orientation is associated with desirable study strategies, so the instructor should strive to establish a master-approach class goal structure. There are many possible course revisions to accomplish this.\nOne set of potential course revisions can be grouped under the heading of “mastery coaching.” Mastery coaching involves repeated statements by the instructor that emphasize learning and understanding how to solve problems. In a flipped classroom, the instructor can engage in mastery coaching while circulation among the students announcing things like “it is good to get stuck because that shows you a point you haven’t yet fully mastered,” and “the purpose of this activity isn’t go get the answer, it’s to make sure you know how to get the answer. If you know that, the correct answer will follow naturally.” Similarly, in class meetings immediately before exams, the instructor can note that “understanding someone else’s solution is not the same as generating the solution independently,” and “a good way to study for an exam is to look at a problem for which a solution is available and try to set up the calculations for solving it without looking at the solution; only look at the solution after you are fininshed or if you get stuck.”\nIntroducing effort-based grading as suggested above also contributes to establishing a mastery-approach goal structure. A further potential revision is to provide the solution to these problems at the time they are assigned, and telling the students that the purpose of the assignment is for them to find out whether they know how to solve this type of problem. Giving them the answer before they start the assignment clearly indicates that getting the correct answer isn’t the purpose.\n\n\nConclusions\nAssessment of ten offerings of an engineering problem-solving course revealed a number of aspects of the course structure and teaching that did not fully align with established principles of how students learn. Instructor observations from those offerings additionally identified maladaptive or sub-optimal student learning behaviors. The assessment results suggest that a performance-approach goal structure exists in the class, and students adopt a performance-approach goal orientation in which getting the correct answer predominates over the mastery-approach goal of knowing how to get the answer. Seven revisions to the course would address many of its shortcomings.\n\n\nCited References"

    "title": "What is the Purpose of Homework?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s been a long time since I was a student in an engineering problem-solving course. I do remember that I was assigned a lot of homework problems, but I don’t recall spending any time consciously thinking about what its purpose was. The professor assigned it, and the score that I earned by submitting it represented some fraction of my final grade in the course. I don’t reccollect any of my professors ever telling me what was the purpose of the homework they assigned. (Some of them may have done so; if they did it went in one ear and out the other.) Reflecting back to those times, I believe that subconsciously I figured that the purpose of homework was to show the professor that I could solve the problems they assigned. In other words, I pretty much considered homework to be a form of evaluation or assessment of my learning.\nThere are at least three problems with that mind-set. First, my goal when solving the problems was to get the correct answer because that was the basis upon which the homework was graded. I was a student before the internet existed, so I couldn’t go online hoping to find the solution to the problem to make sure I got it right. Some fraternities and sororities on campus had files of old exam and homework solutions, but I didn’t have access to any of those, either. So I pretty much ended up solving the problems myself, but when I was done, I’m quite certain that I checked with classmates to see if they got the same answer, and if they didn’t, we’d sit down and try to determine which of us was correct and then revise the incorrect solution.\nI’m very confident that when I solved those problems, I did so primarily by mimicry. That is, I found an example that was solved in the textbook or my class notes, and then I mimicked that solution to get an answer to the problem I’d been assigned. In short, and in part because my goal was to get the correct answer, the second problem with my mindset on the purpose of homework was that I missed opportunities to expand or deepen my knowledge through solving the problems independently. More critically I missed the opportunity to develop my independent problem-solving skills. Those skills evolved gradually, as over time I started to remember how the problems were solved in the solutions I mimicked. It certainly wasn’t the most efficient way to learn how to solve the problems.\nThe third problem relates to feedback. Now to be honest, not much feedback was actually provided. Most of the time, a “correct” solution was posted somewhere (again, pre-internet, so probably inside some glass enclosed bulletin board), and my returned homework may have had some marks. Usually, though the marks were simply a red “X” through an equation or value that was incorrect. It didn’t really matter that much, though, because with my perspective on the purpose of homework (show the professor I could solve the problems they assigned), checking my solution came after the fact and wouldn’t change the result. I think I usually checked “to see what I got wrong” in the hope that I’d remember it when exam time came and not make the same mistake. I didn’t engage in any metacognitive thinking, though, to try to identify flaws in my study habits or to consider whether I knew how to approach the problem. As I said, I solved the problem by mimicry, so the approach I used wasn’t really mine, anyway.\nThe point of this post isn’t to reveal the purpose of homework in a problem-solving course. Homework can serve several purposes. The point is that the purpose for the homework that I (mostly subconsciously) inferred had a significant influence on the methods I used to solve the problem. My next few posts will take a closer look at how the way homework is presented can affect the way students approach it."

    "title": "A Waste of Time",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I don’t know if this is very widely practiced today, but I can remember problem-solving courses that I took where we were not provided with any equations on exams. We were told we should memorize any equations we might need. In my opinion, it is a total waste of a student’s time to require them to memorize equations for an exam. Here are a few reasons why.\nThe time a student spends memorizinng equations, instead could be spent making sure they know how to use those equations. Is the goal of the course to know equations or to know how to use them?\nIn my own professional life, there are some equations that I just know. That’s because I use them all the time, not because I consciously attempted to memorize them. More importantly, when I have a problem to solve, I don’t rely on my memory of an equation. If I have the slightest doubt, I pull out a text or reference book and make sure I have the equation written correctly. In fact, I could argue that it is more important for a student to know where to find an equation than it is to have it memorized. Why force a student to solve a problem using equations pulled from their memory if practicing engineers don’t do so?\nMemorizing an equation has no lasting impact. If they don’t use the equation regularly, they will eventually forget it. Going back to how people learn, one of the principles is that to develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned. Yes, it is important to know the equation (or at least that it exists), but for lasting impact it is equally important to know when to use it and to have practiced doing so.\nIf students are expected to memorize equations, doing so should be listed as one of the course objectives, and that raises another problem. If memorizing equations is a course objective, then it should be assessed separately from other course objectives. If the only evaluation of whether a student has memorized an equation is putting a problem that requires its use on an exam, the the evaluation is likely flawed. Presumably there is also a course objective that the student is able to solve problems that require its use. A student could fail to solve this exam problem because (a) they failed to memorize the equation, in part or in whole, (b) they do not know how to use the equation or (c) they are unable to integrate other necessary knowledge into their solution. So unless the grading of the exam problem is very detailed, the problem will not facilitate the separate assessment of any one of the learning objectives.\nNow if you are a student reading this, you are pretty much out of luck with respect to having to memorize equations. If your instructor requires it, it doesn’t matter that I think its a waste of time, you still need to memorize the equations. One thing I sometimes found useful in this situation was knowing how to derive the equation instead of memorizing it. This can be useful in two ways. First, if it is a simple derivation, it may be more efficient to just derive it on an exam. Even if the derivation is more involved, knowing the derivation can help, for example, if you can’t remember whether a given term is positive or negative. Knowing how it is derived may make it clear to you.\nBack to the instructors in the crowd, what are the alternatives to requiring students to memorize equations? One I’ve seen used is to allow the students to make a one-page (or x-page) “cheat sheet” that they are allowed to use during each exam. One issue with this approach is that they can include a lot more than just equations on such a cheat sheet. For example, they could include a few key solved problems on it to use as guides to solving the exam questions. Also it can create an uneven playing field. Is the purpose of the exam to determine who has learned how to solve the problems at hand, or who can make the most helpful cheat sheet?\nAn extreme version of the cheat sheet is an open-book exam. One problem I’ve seen with this is that the instructor often feels they need to make the exam problems much more difficult since the students will have access to the book. As such, the students may not have practiced solving problems with a difficulty level that high. A second problem I’ve seen is that some students don’t study as hard for an open book exam. As a consequence, some spend more time paging through the book than they do showing what they know.\nI don’t claim to have the answer, but here’s what I do. Before the course begins, I compile a course equation summary that includes most of the equations that are used over the course of the semester. It’s typically 3 pages long. The equations are in groups (in my case, thermo equations, reactor design equations, etc.), but they are not individually identified. By not identifying the individual equations, it becomes necessary for the students to be able to pick out which one they need for a particular problem. I feel that having the ability to do so shows some level of understanding of the subject.\nAs an example, in my course a large number of the problems involve one of four types of reactors. The equations used to model each type of reactor are slightly different from each other. Thus, when an exam question involves one specific type of reactor, the students still need to be able to pick out the equations for that reactor type from among those for all the other reactor types. In other words, it requires a little bit of familiarity with the equations that typically comes from having practiced solving problems before the exam.\nI give them the equation summary on day one of the course. I encourage them to use it, and not the book or notes or whatever, when solving problems in class and for homework. I promise them that the exact same equation summary will be included as part of every exam. In this way, they gain familiarity with the equation summary prior to the exam.\nIn the end, I think the equation summary, the cheat sheet, or (to a lesser extent the open book) are all better than forcing students to memorize equations. To me, it is more important that they know which equation to use in a given problem-solving context and how to use it than to have memorized it. I’d rather they spend their exam preparation time practicing those skills instead of memorizing equations."

    "title": "ToTaL PS, What’s it all about?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "ToTaL PS is a blog I created to share my “Thoughts on Teaching and Learning Problem-Solving,” (ToTaL PS). “Problem-Solving” can have multiple meanings. Here the focus is actually on undergraduate college level science and engineering problem-solving courses. For the purposes of this blog, these are courses where the professor presents theory and equations and shows how to use the theory and apply the equations to explain and predict how some physical system performs. Most, if not all, of the student learning outcomes for this type of problem-solving course center on the learner being able to use the theory and equations to answer questions about the performance of systems to which they apply.\nThe problems in these courses are often referred to as “word problems” or “story problems.” Typically they consist of a few paragraphs that describe a system and provide information about how it is being operated. Then they ask one or more questions about how the system performs or how the system should be operated to achieve some desired performance. The problems can be classified as response, optimization or design problems. In a response problem the system and the way it is operated are specified and the question asks the student to determine the value of a specific input, output or system parameter. Optimization problems typically involve questions asking for specification of one or more system properties or operating parameters that maximize or minimize some other specified system output or response. Design problems differ in that they allow the problem-solver to make choices about one or more system properties or operating parameters with the goal of achieving or optimizing a specified system response. Optimization and design problems may also be constrained. In a constrained problem restrictions are placed upon the allowed answers to the questions being asked. Problems can also be classified as being open-ended or not. An open-ended problem has more than one “correct” answer. Design problems are open-ended, and optimization problems can be. In contrast, a problem that is not open-ended has a single answer that is correct. Most response problems are not open-ended.\nAnother characteristic of the kind of problem-solving courses that this blog focuses upon is that the students are assigned homework problems or sets of homework problems. In principle, these homework problems align with the course learning objectives. That is, when a learner can solve one of these problems correctly, it is an indicator that the learner has fulfilled one of the course learning objectives. Beyond homework problems, problem-solving courses very often use exams to evaluate the degree to which students have achieved the course learning objectives. As with homework problems, the problems included in exams typically align with the course learning objectives.\nI have been teaching problem-solving courses like the one I’ve described here since 1980. Before that, I was a student in many problem-solving courses. Over the years I’ve used different course structures, teaching methods, modes of evaluation, etc. Some of them worked and some didn’t. I’ve also used different approaches to learn myself, and observed students using a variety of learning approaches. Again, some learing strategies are more effective than others.\nIn more recent years, I’ve done some applied research on teaching and learning in problem-solving courses. So I decided to start this blog as a place where I can share my thoughts and experiences in case someone might be interested. I expect that most posts will be introduced from an instructor’s perspective, but I intend to discuss them from the perspectives of learners and instructors. Hopefully there will be some useful, or at least thought-provoking, information for both."

    "text": "OK, practice is an important aspect of learning, but in a problem-solving context, what needs to be practiced? To paraphrase one of the seven principles of learning1 in the context of a problem-solving course: to develop problem-solving mastery, students must acquire component skills and knowledge, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned.\nSo, a prerequisite to developing problem-solving mastery is the acquisition of component skills and knowledge. The are several kinds of “component skills and knowledge” that are necessary. One is a knowledge of definitions of terms associated with the problem type. Another is familiarity with the equations used when solving the problem type. If the students are required to memorize them, that is part of the component knowledge; if not, the ability to identify them is necessary. The component knowledge also includes understanding the assumptions that are inherent in the equations used to solve the problem type. Most problem-solving courses have pre-requisite coursework. Equations, definitions, etc. from pre-requisite courses that may be used for solving the problem type are also included in the component knowledge. In most cases, knowing how to perform the mathematics and/or write the computer code for solving the problem type is a component skill. Simplification of the equations (elimination of neglible terms, etc.) is another component skill.\nAll of those component skills and knowledge are fairly obvious. There are two others that are not as obvious, and, unfortunately, they are often not taught in problem-solving courses. They relate to the last part of the learning principle: knowing when to apply what they have learned. Knowing how to identify each of the different problem types encountered in the course, and, having identified the type of a problem, knowing the general prodcedure that is followed when solving that type of problem are essential component knowledge items. As I said, they often are not taught, perhaps with the assumption that they will be learned when completing homework assignments. I believe that they should be presented at the same time the other forms of component skills and knowledge are presented, and they should be emphasized.\nAs an example, in one problem-solving course that I teach, there are five basic types of problems. The same general equations are used when solving four of the five problem types, but the equations are used in very different ways with very different objectives. When I present each of the five basic problem types, I talk about how that type of problem can be identified and I list a set of distinguishing characteristics that can be used to differentiate that type of problem from other types of problems. I follow that immediately with a description of the general steps that need to be taken when solving that type of problem.\nNext, when I present examples of solving that type of problem, I try to always start by explaining how I identified the problem type and knew what to do to solve it. As an instructor, it is easy to leave this out because being an expert in the subject, the instructor does this almost sub-consciously. It is a form of “instructor blind spot” where something is so obvious to the instructor that they don’t mention it, forgetting that it is not necessarily obvious at all to a student. The same problem exists in the examples presented in many textbooks. After presenting the assignment, they jump immediately into the solution and never mention how one would know where or how to start.\nThe problem is exacerbated by the general structure of courses and textbooks. Both tend to proceed sequentially from one type of problem to the next. When a student is assigned a homework problem, they never need to identify the type of problem involved because the assignment is associated to specific classes in the course and specific chapters in the book where that type of problem is presented. They know the problem type based on the chapter in the book it comes from or the classes they attended during the past week.\nIn contrast, it is not uncommon for exams to include more than one type of problem derived from different classes or book chapters. If students have not been taught how to identify a problem’s type and had an opportunity to practice it, the exam may be the first time they need to do so.\nA similar issue is associated with knowing the general procedure used to solve a given type of problem. A student may understand everything that the instructor presents in class while solving a given problem type. Most students probably won’t even realize that the instructor never explained how they (the instructor) knew what to do. Later, when they are assigned that type of problem to complete for homework, they may realize after reading the problem statement that they don’t know where to start or how to proceed. To find out, they likely will look back at class notes or textbook examples and see what steps the expert took when solving the problem, and they will take the same steps.\nI refer to this as the mimicry approach to solving problems. One issue with this approach is that they are practicing solving problems using available solutions as a “recipe.” Eventually, after solving enough problems of a given type, the student will associate the recipe with the problem type, but not through a conscious effort to do so. A more efficient and effective approach is to explicitly tell the students that they need to know the “recipe” for each type of problem they will solve and to teach them that recipe. That is, to make sure they understand that the “recipe” is an important part of the component knowledge they must consciously acquire in order to become a proficient problem-solver.\nSo what does needs to be practiced in a problem-solving course? First students need to practice identifying a problem’s type, and to do that they first must have acquired the knowledge of how to identify a problem’s type. Second, students need to practice knowing which of the component skills and knowledge that they have acquired are needed for solving a particular problem type. Again, the general approach for solving a particular type of problem should be part of that previously-acquired component knowledge. Finally students need to practice actually using their knowledge and skills to solve problems.\nPutting it differently, students won’t automatically know when to apply each bit of knowledge they have acquired. Instructors can help them by teaching them how to identify different problem types and a general approach for each problem type that inchldes which bits of knowledge are needed and how to use them. Instructors can further help students by giving them opportunities to practice all of these things."

    "text": "This will be my last post for 2023. To put it succinctly, I’ve been presenting and organizing my posts by teaching topic, and instead, I want to use a chronological approach. For the most part, my posts have attempted to present a generalized description of something I tried while teaching a chemical engineering problem-solving course on kinetics and reaction engineering. This makes each topic I introduce appear to be a stand-alone item whereas in reality, all of the things I’ve tried are inter-related. As a result I’m finding it difficult to fully explain why I tried something and to discuss the results thoroughly because much of the background is missing.\nI try to assess my teaching periodically, identify weaknesses and strengths, and make adjustments to hopefully address the weaknesses. So I’m going to take a month or so to plan, and when I resume posting in 2024, I’ll start with an assessment of my kinetics and reaction engineering problem-solving course from back in 2005. I’ll assess the way the course was being taught, identify things I wanted to do better, describe what I did to try to improve those aspects of the course and the reasoning behind them. Then I’ll jump ahead a few years and present an assessment of the course after those adjustments and repeat the cycle. It’s my hope that instructors and students will still find the ideas and information useful when presented in this way, but I guess we’ll see…."
